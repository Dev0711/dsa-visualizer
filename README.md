# DSA Visualizer — Phase 1

A Spring Boot service that compiles a pasted LeetCode-style `Solution` class
in memory, launches it as a real child JVM, attaches a debugger to it via
JDI (Java Debug Interface — the same API IntelliJ/Eclipse use internally),
and steps through it line by line, capturing local variable values at every
step. The end goal (across later phases) is a synced code-highlight +
animated data-structure visualizer for arrays, HashMap, LinkedList, Tree,
and Graph — this repo is Phase 1: prove the compile→debug→trace pipeline
works, surfaced through a plain REST endpoint + a no-framework HTML test
page (React comes in Phase 2).

**Run environment confirmed by the project owner:** JDK 17+ and Maven 3.8+
already installed locally (Windows, paths like `D:\dsa-visualizer`).
Developed/iterated in IntelliJ using both `java -jar` and the IDE's
Run/Debug button.

---

## ⚠️ The one thing that will block you if you skip it

`com.sun.jdi.*` lives in the **`jdk.jdi` module**, which is NOT on the
default module path. Skipping this gives a `ClassNotFoundException` or
`module not found` error the moment `JdiStepEngine` is touched.

**You must explicitly add the module** when both *compiling* and *running*
this Spring Boot app itself (not the debuggee — the debuggee is just plain
user code with no JDI dependency of its own).

### Compiling (Maven)

```bash
export JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS="--add-modules jdk.jdi"
mvn clean package
```

### Running — three ways, pick whichever fits your workflow

**Terminal / jar:**
```bash
java --add-modules jdk.jdi -jar target/dsa-visualizer.jar
```

**IntelliJ Run/Debug button:** Run/Debug Configurations → your
`DsaVisualizerApplication` config → "Modify options" → enable **VM options**
field → enter:
```
--add-modules jdk.jdi
```
Apply → OK, then use the green ▶ Run or 🐞 Debug button as normal. Debug
mode is genuinely useful here since you're debugging a debugger — you can
breakpoint inside `JdiStepEngine.java` itself and inspect the live JDI
event loop (`eventSet`, `vm.allThreads()`, etc.).

If `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` is already exported in your shell from the build
step, plain `java -jar target/dsa-visualizer.jar` also picks it up
automatically.

---

## Prerequisites

- **A full JDK 17+** (not just a JRE). Verify with `javac -version` and
  `java -version` — both must report the same major version, and `javac`
  must exist. The app throws a clear error if
  `ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler()` returns null (JRE-only install).
- **Maven 3.8+**
- Nothing else — no Lombok, no DB. Lean on purpose for Phase 1.

---

## Running it end to end

```bash
cd dsa-visualizer
export JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS="--add-modules jdk.jdi"
mvn clean package
java -jar target/dsa-visualizer.jar
```

Then open `src/main/resources/static/index.html` **directly in your
browser** (double-click it — no dev server needed; CORS is wide open in
`VisualizeController` for exactly this reason). It's pre-filled with a Two
Sum example. Hit **"Compile & Trace"** and you should see the code panel
highlight the current line, a live variables panel, Prev/Next stepping, and
the final return value.

---

## How a request flows through the code

1. **`VisualizeController`** (`/api/visualize`) — receives
   `{ solutionCode, methodName, args }` as JSON.
2. **`VisualizationService.visualize()`** — orchestrates everything below,
   wrapped in a try/finally that always cleans up the temp directory:
   - **`CodeWrapper.wrap()`** — keeps the pasted class **byte-for-byte**
     (so JDI's reported line numbers match what the user sees in the
     editor) and appends a generated `Main` class with parsed argument
     literals and a call to the target method. Both classes are kept
     **non-public** so the generated file can have any filename.
   - **`SignatureParser`** — regex-extracts the target method's return type
     and parameter types/names from the pasted code. Deliberately
     regex-based, not full AST parsing — sufficient for typical LeetCode
     signatures; see Known Limitations below for where this will need
     upgrading.
   - **`ArgLiteralBuilder`** — turns each raw string arg (e.g.
     `"2,7,11,15"`) into a valid Java literal declaration (e.g.
     `int[] arg0 = {2,7,11,15};`). Supports `int`, `long`, `double`,
     `boolean`, `char`, `String`, and 1D arrays of those.
   - **`CompilerService.compile()`** — `javax.tools.JavaCompiler` in
     memory, compiling to real `.class` files on disk (required since the
     debuggee must be a launchable child process, not just bytes in
     memory). Compiled with `-g` for full debug info — **non-negotiable**,
     since JDI needs this for variable names and accurate line numbers.
   - **`JdiStepEngine.trace()`** — launches the compiled `Main` as a real
     child JVM via JDI's `CommandLineLaunch` connector, installs a
     `ThreadStartRequest` first (to reliably catch the main thread even for
     fast-finishing code — see Bug #2 below for why this matters), then a
     line-step request filtered to skip `java.*`/`javax.*`/`sun.*`/`jdk.*`
     internals, and pumps the JDI event queue. Captures a `StepSnapshot`
     (line number + all visible local variables) every time execution
     lands on a line inside the user's `Solution` class specifically
     (Main's own setup lines are filtered out).
   - **`JdiValueConverter`** — unwraps JDI's remote-proxy `Value` objects
     into plain Java values Jackson can serialize. Primitives/String/arrays
     convert directly. As of the toString() fix (see Bug #3 below),
     `java.util.*`/`java.lang.*` objects (HashSet, HashMap, ArrayList, etc.)
     are rendered by actually invoking their `toString()` live in the
     debuggee. Custom user-defined types (future TreeNode/ListNode) still
     render as an opaque `<ClassName#id>` placeholder pending Phase 3/4's
     pointer-chasing work.
3. Response: `VisualizeResponse` — `success` with the full step array +
   return value + original source lines, or `failure` with a phase
   (`compile`/`input`/`internal`/`trace-truncated`) and message. **On
   compile failure specifically**, the response also includes
   `generatedSource` — the exact `.java` file text that was sent to
   `javac` — so the test page can show you precisely what failed instead
   of leaving you to guess.

---

## Bugs found and fixed so far (chronological, for context)

### Bug #1 — `IncompatibleThreadStateException` not caught (compile error)
`thread.frame(0)` and `frame.getValue()` both declare this checked
exception in the JDI API. Original code only caught
`AbsentInformationException`. **Fix:** both exceptions now caught together
in `JdiStepEngine.captureSnapshot()`.

### Bug #2 — Return type regex capturing the access modifier (compile error)
The regex's optional `(?:public|private|protected)?` group could match
zero characters while the non-greedy return-type capture group swallowed
`"public boolean"` (or `"public int[]"`, etc.) together as one unit —
because whitespace was part of that group's allowed character class. This
generated invalid Java like `public boolean result = solution.foo(...);`
as a **local variable declaration**, which doesn't compile (`public` isn't
a valid modifier there). This affected **every example tested**, including
the original Two Sum default.

**Fix:** added `SignatureParser.stripLeadingModifiers()`, which strips
`public`/`private`/`protected`/`static`/`final` off the front of whatever
the regex captured, regardless of which group accidentally consumed them.
Verified by hand-simulation against `boolean`, `int[]`, `void`, and
multiple full sample problems (Two Sum, Contains Duplicate, Reverse
String, Valid Anagram) before shipping.

### Bug #3 (not a bug, a gap) — Collections rendered as empty string / opaque placeholder
`HashSet`/`HashMap`/`ArrayList` etc. are regular Java objects, so they hit
the generic `ObjectReference` branch in `JdiValueConverter`, which only
ever produced a placeholder like `<java.util.HashSet#12345>` — not genuinely
broken, just not useful for a *visualizer* where the user needs to actually
see `seen = [1, 2]`.

**Fix:** rather than hand-walking `HashMap`'s internal `table`/`Node` array
(real pointer-chasing work, same complexity tier as the LinkedList/Tree
support already scoped for later phases), `JdiValueConverter` now calls
`ObjectReference.invokeMethod(...)` to invoke the **live object's own
`toString()`** inside the debuggee, for `java.util.*`/`java.lang.*` types
only. This reuses each collection's already-correct `toString()` instead of
reimplementing bucket-array traversal.

**Safety boundary, deliberately enforced:** `invokeMethod` actually
**resumes the debuggee thread** to run the method, then re-suspends it —
running arbitrary live code as a side effect of inspecting a variable is
only acceptable for trusted standard-library types with known-safe
`toString()` implementations. It is intentionally **never** invoked on
custom user-defined types (e.g. a future pasted `TreeNode`/`ListNode`
class), both for safety (an unknown `toString()` could misbehave) and
because those types are meant to be rendered as actual structural diagrams
later, not flattened strings.

**Verification status:** the JDI `invokeMethod` signature and exception
types were checked against Oracle's official JDI docs, and the event-loop
structure was traced to confirm `captureSnapshot()` (and the nested
`invokeMethod` call) always completes before `eventSet.resume()` is called
— meaning this doesn't fall into the deadlock scenario the JDI docs warn
about (calling `invokeMethod` from inside a still-blocked
`SUSPEND_ALL`-pending event handler). This was **not** executed against a
real JVM during development (the dev sandbox used has no JDK/JDI module
available) — it's spec-verified and logic-traced, not end-to-end tested.
If collection rendering still misbehaves, that's the next thing to debug.

---

## Known Phase 1 limitations (by design, not bugs)

- **No `TreeNode`/`ListNode`/2D-array argument support yet.**
  `ArgLiteralBuilder` throws a clear `UnsupportedOperationException` if you
  try passing one as an argument — Phase 3/4 scope (needs pointer-chasing
  construction logic, not array literals).
- **Custom object types still render as `<ClassName#id>` placeholders**
  in the variables panel, not their contents — see Bug #3 above. Only
  `java.util.*`/`java.lang.*` types get readable `toString()` rendering.
- **No recursion call-stack visualization yet.** The engine traces
  whichever frame is on top of the stack; recursive calls show repeated
  entries into the same lines, but call-stack depth itself isn't
  visualized separately yet.
- **`SignatureParser` is regex-based, not AST-based.** Handles standard
  single-line-ish signatures fine (including brace-on-next-line — verified
  this actually already works, contrary to an earlier assumption). May
  need upgrading for generics in return types, annotations on the method,
  or multi-line parameter lists with complex generic bounds.
- **The HTML test page hardcodes exactly two argument input boxes**
  (`arg0`, `arg1`). A method needing 3+ parameters will need either manual
  HTML edits or the Phase 2 React rewrite (which should generate input
  fields dynamically from the parsed signature).
- **5000-step / 15-second hard caps** (`JdiStepEngine.MAX_STEPS` /
  `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`) guard against accidentally pasted infinite loops.
  Bump these constants if you need to trace something longer-running.
- **One request at a time, conceptually.** Each request gets its own fresh
  temp dir and child JVM (safe for concurrency), but nothing pools or
  rate-limits child JVM processes — fine for local dev, worth revisiting
  before any real deployment.

## Suggested next debugging step if something goes wrong

1. **`jdk.jdi` module not added** → see the warning at the top of this file.
2. **`javac` missing** → JRE not JDK on `JAVA_HOME`.
3. **Compile error from generated source** → the API response includes
   `generatedSource` on compile failure; the test page's code panel
   displays it directly so you can see exactly what was sent to `javac`
   instead of guessing.
4. **Method not found** → check the method name field matches exactly
   (case-sensitive), and that the signature has a normal modifier+type
   pattern (e.g. `public int[] foo(...)`) — see `SignatureParser`'s
   limitations above.
5. **A variable shows as `<ClassName#id>`** → that's an object type not yet
   covered (custom class, or a `java.util` type not yet tested) — not
   necessarily a bug, see Known Limitations.

## Roadmap (matches what's been discussed and agreed)

- **Phase 1 (this repo, current status: functioning end-to-end for
  array/String/primitive problems using HashMap/HashSet/ArrayList)** — REST
  + plain HTML test page. ✅ mostly done, modulo whatever the next test
  session turns up.
- **Phase 2** — React frontend: proper syntax-highlighted code view (e.g.
  CodeMirror or `react-syntax-highlighter`), animated array-box
  visualization synced to a step slider, dynamically generated input forms
  from the parsed method signature (fixing the hardcoded-two-args
  limitation above).
- **Phase 3** — LinkedList + Tree support: real pointer-chasing through
  `.next` / `.left` / `.right` fields via JDI (not toString()), plus
  recursive layout computation for tree rendering.
- **Phase 4** — Graph + HashMap-as-a-visual-structure (distinct from the
  toString()-based rendering already in place — this would be an actual
  bucket/node diagram), call-stack depth visualization for recursion.
